<p className=''>
	This project was developed with ReactJS, being a Dapp application (decentralized application) that replicates the Uniswap web application interface. With this interface it is possible to perform the real login connection with your MetaMask digital wallet previously installed in your browser.

After the connection is established with your MetaMask wallet, you will be able to read the address and, consequently, the ETH balance.
