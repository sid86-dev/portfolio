	A URL shortener, also known as a link shortener, seems like a simple tool, but it is a service that can have a dramatic impact on your marketing efforts.

Link shorteners work by transforming any long URL into a shorter, more readable link. When a user clicks the shortened version, they’re automatically forwarded to the destination URL. Think of a short URL as a more descriptive and memorable nickname for your long webpage address.

If you’re contributing content to the online world, you need a URL shortener. Make your URLs stand out with our easy to use free link shortener above.
