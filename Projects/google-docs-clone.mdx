	Next Google Docs is a web app that uses draft.js to create a document for you. The whole app is wrapped with next-auth google authentication hence one has to be logged in with their google account in order to enjoy the application. It also uses Firebase to store all the user's and document data.
The frontend has been designed using Tailwind CSS with Material UI wrapper.
