<p className=''>
	Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling
	React-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static
	websites. 
	```jsx 
	let [session] = useSession(); 
	```
	React documentation
	mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains" advising it to developers as a
	solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js".[4] Where
	traditional React apps can only render their content in the client-side
	browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered
	on the server-side.
